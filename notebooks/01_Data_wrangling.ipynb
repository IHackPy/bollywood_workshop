    "\n",
    "Documentation can be found here:\n",
    "- https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html\n",

    "In the case of adding columns of one `DataFrame` to another, we can use `DataFrame.join` (equivalent to SQL `JOIN`). Documentation can be found here:\n",
    "- https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXERCISE:** In this case we want to join the two previously loaded `DataFrame` objects into one. To make sure we implement it correctly, we need to see the check the shape of both `DataFrame` with the method `.shape`, and also check the shape of the resulting `DataFrame` to make sure we are not duplicating or missing rows. When joining, the important parameters are `on` and `how`."

    "pandas has two main containers, `Series` and `DataFrame`. You can think as a `DataFrame` as the content of a spreadsheet, or a SQL table. And `Series` as one of its columns.\n",

    "As you can see in the example, every value can be defined by its position based on its labels. For example, the value at `PK`/`Genre` is `Comedy`. In pandas, this would be `movies.loc['PK', 'Genre']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, every value cab be defined by its position. For example, in the second row, and first column, the value is `2001`. In pandas this would be `movies.iloc[1, 0]` (remember that in Python, the first index is `0`, the second is `1`...)\n",
